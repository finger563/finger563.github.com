I've started a `math` section on this site which is where I'll write
about various mathematical concepts, the relationships to each other
and the world, and some writing trying to tie them together in some
way.  Similarly to the amplituhedron and kernel functions (both of
which show how complex non-linear problems can be
simplified/linearized in higher dimensions), my aim with the
math/physics I study is to make sense of geometry, space, and physics.
I'm hopeful that such an approach might be useful for solving the
n-body problem, though I won't be the person to do such a thing.
At the very least I'll be learning new concepts and how they're
interrelated to other concepts I use on a daily basis, and that's cool
for me.
