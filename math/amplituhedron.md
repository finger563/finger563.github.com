This is where I'll talk about higher-dimensional generalizations and
linearizations of hard problems to make them simpler, easier, and
faster to analyze or solve.  The amplituhedron is a good example
because it takes a previously challenging problem of calculating the
particle interactions and reduces it to a geometry problem.  This
concept is the central idea that I like (and hope to see more of)
wherein geoemetry and geometrical/dimensional structure is shown to
have a direct application in and relationship with the physical world
and the analysis of it that we do.
